## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 5. Icon Bounce Back Effect
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Description**:
- After the 3D hover, when mouse leaves, icon has a slight "bounce back" spring effect
- More playful and engaging than just reverting
- Uses spring physics for natural movement

**Implementation**:
- Changed icon transition from standard cubic-bezier to elastic spring timing
- Used `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)` for overshoot effect
- Increased duration to 600ms for icon (was 300ms)
- Applied same spring effect to label with 500ms duration
- Icon "overshoots" slightly when returning to original position, then bounces back

**Benefits**:
- More satisfying interaction when mouse leaves
- Adds personality and playfulness to the UI
- Complements existing 3D pop-out effect perfectly
- Creates a delightful micro-interaction

**Files Modified**:
- `/web/src/components/MenuLink.vue`
